# Coffee Mate 

This is the frontend of my capstone project for Ada Developers Academy. Made with React Native, this iOS mobile application matches users with a coffee shop based on their preferences.

### Features:
Users can swipe left or right on their coffee shop matches, similar to Tinder. Upon match, users can share their location with their contacts by clicking on a button which opens the Messages app on their phone.

### Instructions:
* Download the Expo application on your phone
* Clone this repository on your local machine
* Run `$ npm start` and scan the QR code provided on your terminal
* Open the Expo app on your phone to view the project
